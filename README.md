üêõ code padding not detected properly (ie sometime an instruction not present will be decoded)

## How it works?
ESET created the code samples and a compiler that receive in input an "easm" file (a sort of assembly language, as you can see in the examples) and produce a compiled output with extension ".evm".

The emulator take as an input an "evm" file and emulates it, accordingly to the specifics. The expected output of each code samples is described inside `samples/samples.txt` file.

The VM reads the entire input file and creates code sections like described in the document; a section for the code and a section for the data, plus a the file header.
First thing done is the creation of the main thread: every new thread is created with `pcreate_thread` with its own private context (registers). Each thread decodes and executes the code without waiting for other threads.

## Examples

### `samples/fibonacci_loop.easm`

```
.dataSize 0
.code

loadConst 0, r1 # first
loadConst 1, r2 # second

loadConst 1, r14 # loop helper

consoleRead r3

loop:
	jumpEqual end, r3, r15

	add r1, r2, r4
	mov r2, r1
	mov r4, r2
	
	consoleWrite r1
	
	sub r3, r14, r3
	jump loop
end:
	hlt
```

Note: the last instruction is wrongly decoded because of the bug mentioned on top.
It has been compiled with:
```
5 #define DEBUG_PRINT_INSTR
12 #define ESETVM2_DISASSEMBLY
```

### Self made example: `thread.evm`

```
  1 .dataSize 18
  2 .code     
  3 
  4 loadConst 1, r1
  5 createThread threadProc, r0
  6 createThread threadProcTest, r15
  7 
  8 loadConst 75, r14          
  9 sleep r14                  
 10 
 11 loadConst 8, r1            
 12 loadConst 0x34, r2         
 13 mov r2, qword[r1]          
 14 
 15 consoleWrite qword[r1]     
 16 
 17 joinThread r0              
 18 joinThread r15             
 19 
 20 hlt
 21 
 22 threadProc:
 23     loadConst 0x12, r2
 24 
 25     loadConst 150, r3
 26     sleep r3
 27 
 28     mov r2, qword[r1]
 29     consoleWrite qword[r1]
 30 
 31     hlt
 32 
 33 threadProcTest:
 34     loadConst 25, r10
 35     loadConst 0x7788, r7
 36     
 37     loadConst 100, r8
 38     sleep r8
 39 
 40     mov r7, dword[r10]
 41     consoleWrite dword[r10]
 42 
 43     hlt
```

Multiple executions in order to see changes in the output (because of multi-threading):<br>
